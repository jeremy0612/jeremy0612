- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeremy0612
- 👀 I’m currenty interested in the combination of technologies and exploring new techniques and theories in CS such as AIoT, embedded AI, federrated learning, quantum machine learning, decentralized systems, edge intelligence, etc...
Since my major in the college is embedded system & IoT, I have a deep understanding about the history of computer construction and development from the scratch. Having learned about computer arch, org, network lead me to a conclusion in the relation between hardware and software. Despite the root understanding, I usually do well in software  due to my practical background.
- 🌱 I have fundamental knowledge about many programming languages but I mostly use Python and C/C++ for daily tasks. Eventhough I has coverred a wide essential skill set in Computer science and engineering: DE (database design, SQL, NoSQL, datapipeline, datawarehouse, ACID ); DevOps (linux, cloud computing, docker, microservices ); Dev (pyspark, OOP, SOLID, AL&DS ); MCU (atmega, 8051, esp-idf, raspi), I am not actually master in anything and need more practices. I am tending to try on AI/ML with a seriousity, my desire is to utilize ML with others technologies to create awesome solutions. So I am really willing to work with people from any roles (MLOps, DS,etc,..) and to fill my missing gap.
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaboration in learning, researching and building useful technology products.
- 📫 Really appreciate for your contributions
